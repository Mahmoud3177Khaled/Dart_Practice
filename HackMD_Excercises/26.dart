// Title: HackMD Excercise #26

// Purpose: For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are,
// and be able to find that information based on their name.

// Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays.
// When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them.
